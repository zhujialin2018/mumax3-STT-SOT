# mumax3-STT-SOT

## This software currently has many problems and is not recommended for computational simulations and experimentsÔºÅ

based on mumax3, with sot(spin orbit torque)

new APIs:

SOThickness : free layer thickness in sot (m)

HFLoverHDL : ratio of field-like term to damping-like term

JSOT : electrical current density in sot (A/m2) 

SOTFixedLayer : FixedLayer in sot

SPINHALL : spin hall angle

DisableSOTorque : Disable SOT torque
